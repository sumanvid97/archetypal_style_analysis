# Archetypal Style Analysis

This project was undertaken as a part of the course [CS 726: Advanced Machine Learning](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/cs726/).

The work is based on this paper [Unsupervised Learning of Artistic Styles with
Archetypal Style Analysis](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7893-unsupervised-learning-of-artistic-styles-with-archetypal-style-analysis.pdf) and includes some additional insights on their proposed improvement over the original [Universal Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08086.pdf) work. 

Feel free to check out the [report](150010020_150050040_150040095.pdf) for more details.
